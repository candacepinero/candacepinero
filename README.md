### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Candace and I am a software engineer. I was introduced to coding by a friend. I enjoy learning new skills, and I decided to give it a try and found that I really enjoyed it. I was working as a team lead at Walmart at the time, and started teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on my breaks in my car. I joined GA in April of 2022 and started my journey to becoming a software engineer. 


## Current coding languages
 HTML,
 CSS,
 JavaScript.
 Python,
 React.js
