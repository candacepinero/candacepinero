### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Candace and I am a software engineer. I started my journey to becoming a software engineer in April 2022, after being introduced to coding by a friend. I was working as a team lead at Walmart at the time, and started teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on my breaks in my car. I attended General Assembly's 12 week Full Stack Immersive program and spent the next 3 months learning Languages/Technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Python, jQuery, Express, EJS, Django, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Node.js, Material-UI, and Materialize. I graduated from GA in July of 2022, and continue to develop my skills as a software engineer.
